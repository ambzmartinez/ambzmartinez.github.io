                <p id="title">My name is Amber Martinez</p>
                <p>I am an online student studying Software
                Engineering and Entrepreneurship from Brigham Young University - Idaho.
                I have been married to my wonderful husband for 9 months now.
                We like to travel and go on adventures. I am also an artist, I like all arts 
                and crafts. It's been a while since I've worked with Web Development. I hope 
                that I can refresh on old concepts and learn new ones during this course.</p>
